# 1389 Scouting App

When designing this app, we had a few capabilities that we believed were primary goals

1. Offline and Online Capability
	* Push data when online
	* Hold data when offline

2. Mac, Windows, and Linux Compatibility
	* We settled on a CLI, BASH (Bourne Again Shell) - based app because it was the most simple and straightforward
	* The scripts will work regardless of your distro / OS

3. Be Free and Open-Source
	* All code and data is available on github under the team1389 organization

4. Be easily adaptable for other, future games
	* V1.0 - PowerUp
	* V2.0 - Destination: Deep Space

5. Be Simple and Easy to Understand
	* By relying on basic letter and number commands, we keep it as simple as possible
	* All code is thoroughly commented and there is documentation available for the entire app

6. Be programmed and installed in a relatively short time period
	* The basic prompts allow for easy swapping, from the variable names to the prompt names
	* We wanted our new scouts to be able to load the app quickly, from load-in --> Opening Ceremonies
